Here's a sample test for a Full-Stack Developer position with a focus on Next.js. This test is designed to assess your skills in building web applications using Next.js, React, and Node.js. It covers both front-end and back-end development tasks. Please note that this is a general example, and actual interview tests may vary depending on the specific requirements of the company.

**Full-Stack Developer Test - Next.js**

**Front-end (React/Next.js) Tasks:**

**Task 1: Create a Next.js Application**
Create a new Next.js application using the latest version of Next.js and React. The application should have the following features:

- A homepage with a welcome message.
- A navigation menu with links to the homepage and a "Contact" page.
- A "Contact" page with a simple contact form that includes fields for name, email, and message.
- Use CSS (or a CSS framework) to style the application.

**Task 2: Implement Routing**
Implement client-side routing using Next.js's built-in routing system. Ensure that clicking on the "Contact" link takes the user to the "Contact" page without a full page reload.

**Task 3: Form Validation**
Add client-side form validation to the contact form on the "Contact" page. Validate that:
- The name field is not empty and contains only letters.
- The email field is a valid email address.
- The message field is not empty.

Display appropriate error messages if validation fails.

**Task 4: API Integration**
Fetch and display data from a JSON API endpoint of your choice. Create a new page that lists items from the API. Use React hooks or state management to manage the data.

**Back-end (Node.js) Tasks:**

**Task 5: Create a Node.js API**
Create a simple Node.js API using Express.js or any other Node.js framework of your choice. The API should have the following endpoints:
- `POST /api/items`: Accept a JSON object with item data and add it to the list of items.

**Task 6: Database Integration**
Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL) with your Node.js API. Store and retrieve item data from the database instead of an in-memory array.

Remember to follow best practices, use proper coding conventions, and write clean, maintainable code. Good luck with your Full-Stack Developer interview!
